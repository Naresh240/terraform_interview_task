# Terraform Assignment: Multi-Region Infrastructure Deployment

## Task Overview:
    The goal of this assignment is to assess your ability to design and deploy a multi-region infrastructure using Terraform. You will be required to create modular Terraform scripts for provisioning the following resources:

    1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
    2. Security Groups
    3. EC2 Instance
    4. S3 Bucket
    5. MySQL RDS
    6. WordPress Service
    7. Application Load Balancer (ALB) or DNS for WordPress Service

## Requirements:

```Modular Approach:```
●	Implement a modular structure for Terraform scripts.
●	Organize code into separate modules for VPC, Security Groups, EC2, S3, RDS, and WordPress.
●	Ensure modules are reusable and can be configured for different regions.
```Multi-Region Deployment:```
●	Design Terraform scripts to support deployment in multiple AWS regions.
```Resource Configuration:```
●	Define resource configurations for each module.
●	Include appropriate security measures for EC2, RDS, and Security Groups.
```WordPress Service:```
●	Deploy WordPress on an EC2 instance within the VPC.
●	Implement an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or DNS to showcase the WordPress service.
●	Ensure that the ALB/DNS is accessible and displays the WordPress site.

```Documentation:```
●	Provide clear and concise documentation for each module.
●	Include  architecture diagram and any critical considerations.
